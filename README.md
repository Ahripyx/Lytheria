# Lytheria Discord Music Bot

  This discord bot was made for personal use for me and a couple of friends. Taken as a side project to make throughout the summer. Written in C# using plugins of DSharp + Lavalink (for hosting the music side of it.

  Lytheria makes use of an SQL database to hold information such as user data, songs, and playlists. This allows the user to curate their own playlist and come back to it anytime they want without having to queue indivudual songs.
